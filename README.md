# MLProject2023
Machine learning university project for the spring term.

The title of the project is adaptive vision.

This project utilized thermal and visual sensors in order to process still images to detect various vehicles or objects of interest.

Please note that the data for the code cannot be uploaded to to file size. However, I will walk you through running the code.

1. Open the data generation file and first install the poliastro package
2. Run the data generation code to generate 100,000 data points in a csv file
3. With the data, download it to your computer and upload it to google collab
4. Make sure line 28 has the proper path to reach the csv file
5. Run the ML model... note that the pairplot does take time to load. You can comment it out.
6. Run the results visualization
